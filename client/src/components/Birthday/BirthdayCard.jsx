                    I hope this letter finds you well, pardon me for not being able to say this to you in person. But I just want to let you know that occassions like this 
                    are particularly special for a person. I may not be able to celebrate today with you as a real human being, but I will always remember that today is a special day only to you... 
                    Say... Will you be able to take some time off later? I would like to watch a movie with you, or maybe eat some ramen!
                    Oh, I almost forgot to say this!
                    <br />
                    Happy Birthday, dear <span className="addressName">{userData.username}</span>.

                    May this day be as extraordinary and radiant as you are.
