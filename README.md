## NUS Orbital - Milestone 2 Submission

### Team Name :

Assistant AI 助手 AI

### Proposed Level of Achievement :

Apollo 11

### Motivation

Our web application, 助手 AI , which stands for Assistant AI in Japanese, will be a task management web application that allows users to track and organise their due tasks for better productivity and boosts user engagement via implementing a virtual assistant character.

With our Web Application, we aim to add utility and functionality with personalization. We understand that people have personal, work and familial responsibilities, which are all bound to have tasks to be completed. 助手 AI aims to help users organise tasks, record ongoing progress and provide analytics on their current productivity with a personal Assistant AI to serve reminders and engage users as their own personal characters.

### Aim

Our goal is to develop a task management application that helps users to organize their tasks efficiently and encourage commitment to task fulfillment through a personal rewards system.

### User Stories

1.  As a University student who has a lot of tasks at hand, I sometimes don't feel the motivation to complete my tasks.
2.  As a student who always create and organize my tasks on my smartphone, I wish that someone would help me automate that process through voice commands.
3.  As a Computer Science student who spends most of my time in front of a screen, sometimes I get too carried away and notifications of my tasks would go unnoticed and I would miss a deadline, I wish there was an assistant who would verbally remind me of those tasks.
4.  As a University student who has to juggle between multiple tasks of different levels of priorities, I wished there was AI who could help me with that and give reminders based on deadline priority.

### Tech Stack

1.  Frontend - React, HTML, CSS
2.  Backend - Node.js, Express.js
3.  Database - MySQL
4.  Unit Testing - Jest, Vitest & React Testing Library

### User Guide

1.  Users are required to have the following installed: Node.js, Express.js and MySQL
2.  After cloning, users need to setup a MySQL database and configure it to the config folder by matching the name and password
3.  For running the frontend, users may run "npm run dev" from /client
4.  For running the backend, users may run "npm run server" from /server

### Software Engineering Principles

*   **Front-End Unit Testing**
    *   Unit Testing for the frontend components were conducted using Vitest and React Testing-Library. As of now, only the tasks and tasksbox have simple tests to run and more will be added for other units / components.
    *   Certain functions are also unit tested using Jest to ensure that they work as intended.
    *   Some examples of unit tests are shown below:
        
        ![Front-End Unit Testing 1](./images/Front-EndUnitTesting1.png)
        
        ![Front-End Unit Testing 2](./images/Front-EndUnitTesting2.png)
        
        ![Front-End Unit Testing 3](./images/Front-EndUnitTesting3.png)
        
        ![Front-End Unit Testing 4](./images/Front-EndUnitTesting4.png)
        
        ![Front-End Unit Testing 5](./images/Front-EndUnitTesting5.png)
        
*   **BackEnd Unit Testing**
    *   Unit Testing for the backend API server conducted using Postman API Testing to verify that API functions correctly when the request is sent from the client.

*   **Version Control**
    *   Version Control using Github - Working on features on different branches, merge and pull requests.
        
        ![Branches](./images/Branches.png)

*   **Code Readability**
    *   Commenting on code to ensure readability and clarity for developers.
    *   Below are some examples of comments added:
        
        ![Code Readability 1](./images/CodeReadability1.png)
        
        ![Code Readability 2](./images/CodeReadability2.png)
        
        ![Code Readability 3](./images/CodeReadability3.png)
        
*   **Single Responsibility Principle**
    *   Ensuring each component has only one responsibility.

*   **Documentation**
    *   The front-end and back-end of the application has been documented using the format of JSDoc.
    *   Below are some examples of documentation written:
        
        ![Documentation 1](./images/Documentation1.png)
        
        ![Documentation 2](./images/Documentation2.png)
